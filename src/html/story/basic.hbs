  <p>Based on the EDGAR database created by European Commission and Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency released in 2018, countries across the world emitted 37,077 megatonnes.The data only consider carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, but not emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry. In 2017, European Union contributed ten percent of world’s emission. But it has reduced the emission by 16 percent as compared to 2005. The Paris Agreement is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), dealing with greenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance, signed in 2016. The agreement's language was negotiated by representatives of 196 state parties on 12 December 2015. The Paris Agreement's long-term goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels; and to limit the increase to 1.5 °C, since this would substantially reduce the risks and effects of climate change..</p>
  <p>Since 2006, China has been emitting more CO2 than any other country, which is due to the fact that the country has the largest population. When looking at CO2 emissions per person, China's levels are less than half those of the United States (the next largest source of CO2 emissions). India, another emerging economic giant has doubled its emission in 12 years.</p>
